# Tic-Tac-Toe: Refactored from Vanilla JS to TypeScript

**In this project the refactoring process was completed following a video tutorial by Zach Gollwitzer(.@zg_dev)**

The tutorial is an excellent guide that helped deepen my understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript, while also improving the code's structure and scalability.
