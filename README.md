- Section 2: Refactoring the game to use the MVC pattern, with an explanation of its benefits
- Section 3: Refactoring the game to TypeScript, learning how to set up TypeScript from scratch and why it's useful
- Section 4: Refactoring the game to React + TypeScript, explaining how to set up React from scratch and exploring the advantages of React over a Vanilla approach
